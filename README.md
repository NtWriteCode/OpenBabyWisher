# üë∂ OpenBabyWisher

A simple, self-hostable wishlist application designed for new parents to share gift ideas with family and friends. Built with Flask and designed for easy Docker deployment.

## What is OpenBabyWisher?

OpenBabyWisher is a lightweight web application that helps expecting or new parents create and manage a wishlist for their baby. Family and friends can view the wishlist and anonymously indicate when they plan to purchase an item, helping avoid duplicate gifts while maintaining the surprise element.

- **Keep it simple** - Easy to set up and use for both tech-savvy and non-tech family members
- **Self-hosted control** - Keep your data private and under your control

## Goals

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Create a directory for your wishlist:**
   ```bash
   mkdir openbabywisher
   cd openbabywisher
   ```

2. **Find your user ID (important for file permissions):**
   ```bash
   id -u  # Note this number (usually 1000 or 1001)
   id -g  # Note this number (usually same as user ID)
   ```

3. **Create a docker-compose.yml file:**
   ```yaml
   services:
     openbabywisher:
       image: ntwritecode/openbabywisher:latest
       container_name: openbabywisher
       # IMPORTANT: Replace with YOUR user ID from step 2
       # This ensures the container can write to ./data and ./uploads
       user: "1001:1001"  # Change to match your 'id -u' and 'id -g' output
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       environment:
         - SECRET_KEY=your-very-secret-key-change-this
         - API_TOKEN=your-admin-token-change-this
         - BABY_NAME=Emma
         - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/data/wishlist.db
         - PORT=5000
         - NOTIFICATION_URL=  # Optional: Add Shoutrrr URL for notifications
       volumes:
         - ./data:/app/data:rw
         - ./uploads:/app/uploads:rw
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Access your wishlist:**
   - **Public wishlist:** http://localhost:5000
   - **Admin panel:** http://localhost:5000/admin (use your API_TOKEN to log in)

### Using Docker Run

```bash
# Create data directories
mkdir -p data uploads

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name openbabywisher \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/uploads:/app/uploads \
  -e SECRET_KEY="your-very-secret-key-change-this" \
  -e API_TOKEN="your-admin-token-change-this" \
  -e BABY_NAME="Emma" \
  ntwritecode/openbabywisher:latest
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for sessions and security | `your-secret-key-change-this` | **Yes** |
| `API_TOKEN` | Admin authentication token for management | `your-admin-token-change-this` | **Yes** |
| `BABY_NAME` | Your baby's name for personalized titles | `our little one` | No |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///data/wishlist.db` | No |
| `PORT` | Port the application runs on | `5000` | No |

### Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Change the default values!** Always set strong, unique values for `SECRET_KEY` and `API_TOKEN` in production.

### Baby Personalization

Set the `BABY_NAME` environment variable to personalize your wishlist with your baby's name. The app will automatically generate cute variations like:

- **With default "our little one":** "our precious bundle of joy", "our sweet baby", "our little miracle", etc.
- **With custom name "Emma":** "little Emma", "sweet Emma", "our precious Emma", "sunshine Emma", etc.

The title rotates randomly each time the page loads and when switching languages, keeping the experience fresh and delightful!

### Notifications

OpenBabyWisher supports notifications via **Shoutrrr** when someone indicates they want to buy an item. This helps you stay informed about gift purchases in real-time.

#### Setup Notifications

1. **Configure notification URL(s)** (Shoutrrr is automatically installed in Docker):
   ```bash
   # Discord webhook
   export NOTIFICATION_URL="discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
   
   # Slack webhook  
   export NOTIFICATION_URL="slack://webhook_url"
   
   # Email (SMTP)
   export NOTIFICATION_URL="smtp://user:pass@host:port/?from=sender@example.com&to=recipient@example.com"
   
   # Multiple services (use NOTIFICATION_URL_1, NOTIFICATION_URL_2, etc.)
   export NOTIFICATION_URL_1="discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
   export NOTIFICATION_URL_2="slack://webhook_url"
   ```

2. **Test notifications** from the admin panel using the "Test" button.

#### Supported Services

Shoutrrr supports 70+ notification services including Discord, Slack, Telegram, email, Teams, and many more. See the [Shoutrrr documentation](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/) for complete URL format examples.

### Database

OpenBabyWisher uses SQLite by default, which is perfect for personal/family use:
- **No setup required** - Just works out of the box
- **Easy backups** - Simply copy the `data/wishlist.db` file
- **Lightweight** - No separate database server needed
- **Reliable** - SQLite is battle-tested and stable

The database file is stored in the `data/` directory, which should be mounted as a volume to persist data between container restarts.

### File Storage

Images are stored in the `uploads/` directory:
- **Automatic optimization** - Images are resized to 800x600 max resolution
- **Multiple formats** - Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP
- **Size limits** - 16MB maximum file size
- **UUID filenames** - Prevents conflicts and improves security

## Security Considerations

OpenBabyWisher is designed for family use and includes basic security measures, but **it's not bulletproof**:

### What's Protected
- ‚úÖ **Admin authentication** - API token required for management functions
- ‚úÖ **File upload validation** - Only image files allowed, with size limits
- ‚úÖ **Input sanitization** - Basic protection against malicious input
- ‚úÖ **Secure file naming** - UUIDs prevent directory traversal

### Security Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SQL Injection** - Basic protection in place, but not extensively tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **XSS Protection** - Limited protection against cross-site scripting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No HTTPS** - You should use a reverse proxy (nginx/Traefik) for SSL in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No rate limiting** - Could be vulnerable to brute force attacks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No CSRF protection** - Cross-site request forgery protection not implemented

### Recommendations
- **Use behind a reverse proxy** with SSL/TLS termination
- **Set strong passwords** for SECRET_KEY and API_TOKEN
- **Keep it internal** - Don't expose directly to the internet without additional security
- **Regular backups** - Back up your data directory regularly
- **Monitor access** - Check logs for suspicious activity
